TheMacMini09
======================
This is a repo for my website, which currently resides at http://hosting.themacmini09.com. Changes will occur here (http://themacmini09.github.io) before there. Consider this a "testing website."

Testing
-------
This is the testing branch. A lot of code in here is broken, useless, or otherwise unusable. Proceed with caution.

Suggestions
-----------
If you have a suggestion with the website, or if you want something added, removed, or changed, just open a support ticket, and I'll check it out.

Thanks
------
Special thanks to Webflow for the site design template. Thanks to 1&1 for the unlimited web hosting.
